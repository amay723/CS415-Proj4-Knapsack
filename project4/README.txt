To run the c++ code:
> g++ main.cpp && ./a.out

It will prompt you with a question on which numbered test case to run.
Enter in a value 0-9

To run the python code:
> python3 plotter.py

This will take in all of the different text files generated from the different tests run.

Included is the graph from the test cases 0-7 (we ommited 8 and 9 because it messed up the graph too much)

From the data it shows that while dynamic programming is better and finding the best sollutions, the greedy approach was much faster in computing solutions.
